### GUIs

#### ImGui
Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).

#### Blender
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.

### Perceptions

#### OpenFace
We present OpenFace – an open source tool intended for computer vision and machine learning researchers, affective computing community and people interested in building interactive applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace is the ﬁrst open source tool capable of facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation. The computer vision algorithms which represent the core of OpenFace demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all of the above mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of real-time performance and is able to run from a simple webcam without any specialist hardware. [Link](https://github.com/mingfeisun/OpenFace)

#### OpenPose
OpenPose is a library for real-time multi-person keypoint detection and multi-threading written in C++ using OpenCV and Caffe. [Link](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)

#### ElasticFusion
*Kinect sensor based*. Real-time dense visual SLAM system capable of capturing comprehensive dense globally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments explored using an RGB-D camera.

### Machine Learning

#### Keras
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. [Link](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)

#### Reinforcement-learning
This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from
* Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)
* David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, and links to the relevant readings.

### Tools

#### Scrapy
Scrapy is a fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.

#### draw.io
draw.io is an online diagramming web site that delivers the source in this project. draw.io uses the mxGraph library as the base of the stack, with the GraphEditor example from mxGraph as the base of the application part. The mxGraph library build used is stored under /etc/mxgraph/mxClient.js.
